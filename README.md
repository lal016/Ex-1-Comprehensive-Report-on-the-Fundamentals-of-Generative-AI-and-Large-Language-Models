Output:

1️⃣ Foundational Concepts of Generative AI
🔹 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on creating new content such as:

Text

Images

Audio

Video

Code

Instead of only analyzing data, generative models learn patterns from data and generate new outputs that resemble the training data.

🔹 What is a Generative Model?

A Generative Model learns the probability distribution of data and generates new samples from that distribution.

Mathematically, it learns:

𝑃
(
𝑥
)
P(x)

Where:

𝑥
x = data distribution

Unlike discriminative models (which classify), generative models create.

🔹 Types of Generative Models
1. Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

Encoder + Decoder architecture

Learns compressed representation

Used in image generation

2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Two networks:

Generator

Discriminator

Compete with each other

Produces highly realistic images

3. Autoregressive Models

Generate one token at a time

Example: GPT models

4. Diffusion Models

Add noise and learn to remove noise

Used in modern image tools like Stable Diffusion

5. Transformer-Based Models

Use attention mechanism

Foundation of modern LLMs

2️⃣ Major AI Tools in 2024

3️⃣ What is an LLM and How is it Built?
🔹 What is an LLM?

An LLM (Large Language Model) is a deep learning model trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like language.

Examples:

GPT models

Claude

Gemini

🔹 Core Architecture

LLMs are based on the Transformer architecture, introduced in 2017.

Key components:

Tokenization

Embedding Layer

Self-Attention Mechanism

Feed-Forward Neural Networks

Output Probability Distribution

🔹 How LLMs Are Built

Step 1: Data Collection

Books

Articles

Code

Web data

Step 2: Preprocessing

Cleaning

Tokenization

Step 3: Pretraining

Self-supervised learning

Predict next word (language modeling objective)

Step 4: Fine-Tuning

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

Step 5: Deployment

API integration

Safety alignment

Optimization

🔹 Why LLMs Work So Well

Massive data

Billions of parameters

Transformer attention mechanism

GPU/TPU scaling

Distributed training
